## Overview

This project demonstrates a high-performance image classification pipeline leveraging TensorFlow, RAPIDS, and TensorRT to train and optimize a model for fast inference. The CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, is used for training the model. The pipeline integrates:
- **TensorFlow** for model creation and training.
- **RAPIDS cuDF** for GPU-accelerated data manipulation.
- **TensorRT** for optimizing the trained model to run faster on GPUs during inference.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: A deep learning framework used to define, train, and evaluate the model.
- **cuDF**: A GPU-accelerated DataFrame library from RAPIDS, used for efficient data manipulation.
- **cuPy**: A GPU-accelerated NumPy array library for fast computations on the GPU.
- **TensorRT**: A high-performance deep learning inference library from NVIDIA, used to optimize the trained model for inference.
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A well-known image classification dataset used to train the model.
- **TensorBoard**: A visualization tool used to monitor the training process in real time.

## Pipeline Overview
The pipeline includes the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded, and images are normalized. We use cuDF for GPU-accelerated reshaping and manipulation of the image data.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Image data augmentation is applied using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` to increase the diversity of the training set.
3. **Model Definition**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API.
4. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the augmented CIFAR-10 data, with TensorBoard callbacks for real-time training monitoring.
5. **Model Optimization**: The trained model is converted into TensorFlow Lite format and further optimized using TensorRT for efficient inference.
6. **Inference**: The optimized model is used to run inference on new images and make predictions.

## Steps

### 1. Load the CIFAR-10 Dataset
```python
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
